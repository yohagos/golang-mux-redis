# golang-mux-redis

## Description

Creating  an template Project in which I want to combine Go as programming language, Gorilla/Mux library as Web Server (Multiplexer) and Redis as In-Memory Database.

It's an hobby project to practice and deepen my skills. Therefore please overlook it, if there are some bugs or something else ;-)

## Versions

- Redis:latest (Docker Image)
- Go 1.17.3
- Go-Redis V9
