# golang-mux-redis

## Description

Creating an template Project in which I want to combine Go as programming language, Gorilla/Mux library as Web Server (Multiplexer) and Redis as In-Memory Database.

I'm currently only using Gorilla/Mux as Multiplexer, but Gorilla provides a lot more Go Libraries to push your Applications to new heights. So please take a look at their GitHub Page.

### Use Case 

You can print a list of all Users and add a new User. Nothin special xD

It's an hobby project to practice and deepen my skills. Therefore please overlook it, if there are some bugs or something else ;-)

## Versions

- Redis:latest (Docker Image)
- Go 1.19.1
- Go-Redis V9 (Go Library to connect to Redis)

- Air (Live Server for Go Applications)

## Finally
